# Google Books Search
For this repo I create a new React-based Google Books Search app. I used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Pages
Search - User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

Saved - Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
